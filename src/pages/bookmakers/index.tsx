				<h2>What Exactly Are Betting Sites?</h2>
				<span>
					Betting sites are nothing else than online platforms that are licensed to accept and pay
					out bets. They only became popular in the mid-2000s, which is the time where everyone was
					finally able to bask in the wonders of the internet. At first, it was just a collection of
					the most popular US sports market.
				</span>
				<span>
					As everything grew exponentially, players could place bets on things like soccer, cricket,
					winter sports, and just about everything else you can think of. Additionally, there are
					multiple kinds of betting sites United States players can try out. There are versatile
					ones, but you’ll also find specialized sportsbooks, too.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div className={styles.block}>
				<h2>How Do Online Betting Sites Work?</h2>
				<span>
					Whether it’s new betting sites, or old, reliable ones, the formula is still the same.
					Sports betting isn’t rocket science, so you won’t encounter innovations being applied on a
					weekly basis. That’s why knowing how do online betting sites work is an indispensable tool
					to every single bettor. So, how does the magic happen? Obviously, there are many things
					going on behind the scenes, but the mechanism is mostly based around these principles and
					steps:
				</span>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Players provide personal information to sites, mainly as a means of preventing money
						laundering and ensuring that the person is not a problem gambler. All of this info is
						provided when you’re creating an account, and the data is stored within secure
						servers.
					</li>
					<li>
						All the best online betting sites source their lines from oddsmakers. They can be
						employed by the site, but also come from third parties, too. Using a complex network
						of algorithms, formulas, and publicly available data, these professionals generate
						numerical odds that can be bet on.

					</li>
					<li>
						To place a bet, you must select a market that you want to add to your slip. Once you
						add one or more legs to the slip, entering the bet amount will automatically calculate
						your potential winnings.
					</li>
					<li>
						While it may seem like the bet is instantly processed, it’s officially through once
						the website has an official confirmation that the slip has been submitted. You should
						receive a confirmation once that is complete.
					</li>
					<li>
						If you lose your bet, nothing happens. If you win, your potential winnings will be
						automatically added to your balance once all events on the slip have been concluded.
						In case you believe you are wronged, you can contact customer support and an actual
						person will review your case.
					</li>
					<li>
						Did you win on some juicy MLB lines? Great, now is probably the final part of the
						inner workings of a betting site – withdrawals. As long as you have the amount in your
						account balance, you will just have to enter the amount you want to withdraw, pick a
						payment method, and input any additional details.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<span>
					That’s basically the whole process. Usually, we can pinpoint issues in one of these key
					situations as the main culprits behind a bad place to bet. Now, let’s take a look at how
					we rate online betting sites, and what impacts our final verdict the most.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div className={styles.block}>
				<h2>How We Rate Online Betting Sites</h2>
				<span>
					Our reviews can often get a bit complex, and it’s for a reason – we like to unravel the
					inner workings of every website. However, we also want you to know what we prioritize.
					That’s why our team had quite a brainstorming session, in which we determined that there
					are several pillars that form how we rate online betting sites:
				</span>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b className={styles.highlight}>Licensing</b> is very important when assessing whether
						a site is good or not. The best betting sites United States players have access are
						licensed with a legitimate authority. It can be either a US state regulator or a
						government in another country. Regardless, the sites Betting.com recommends have a
						publicly available licensing record and undergo regular audits.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b className={styles.highlight}>Promos</b> showcase a site’s ability to consistently
						reward your loyalty. If you’re going to be spending lots of money on their moneylines
						and other markets, they’d better give make it worth it. For starters, a generous
						welcome bonus will do, followed by a loyalty program and maybe even a top-up.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b className={styles.highlight}>Design</b> and mobile-friendliness also play a large
						role in all of our high ratings. Sure, licensing and lucrative promos are important,
						but all of that’s worthless if you can’t actually use the thing. Betting.com top picks
						must have modern UIs, usable homepages, and intuitive designs.
					</li>
					<li>
						There is nothing better than good <b className={styles.highlight}>customer support</b>
						, as everyone needs help every once in a while. We prefer online betting sites to use
						live chat and be available 24/7, but email and phone support are also usable in some
						cases. All in all, you should be able to reach a dedicated agent in a few minutes.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b className={styles.highlight}>Odds and markets</b> are what you came for, right?
						Sure, we believe that US betting sites are a complex puzzle, but if you can’t find
						value and bet what you want – it’s pointless. The lines have to be consistent and
						above the industry average if you are to make the most out of every slip.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<span>
					And there you have it – the five pillars of every proper website. Now that you’re aware of
					what to look for and what to avoid. With that out of the way, let’s take a look at how to
					place bets on United States betting sites. Learning the process will put you in the best
					position to succeed.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div className={styles.block}>
				<h2>How to Place Bets on United States Betting Sites</h2>
				<span>
					There’s not much to learn when you’re looking at how to place bets on United States
					betting sites, to be honest. Before, things were a bit more complicated, and you had to
					jump through hoops in order to submit a slip. Nowadays, things are much simpler – just
					follow these steps, regardless of where you’re playing:
				</span>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b className={styles.highlight}>Create an account.</b> Remember, this involves
						providing some basic personal information. Verify the account, if need be.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b className={styles.highlight}>Make a deposit.</b> Make sure it’s a payment method
						you’re already familiar with.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b className={styles.highlight}>Choose a sport and a league.</b> Whether it’s NBA,
						NHL, or NFL, or MLB markets, the best betting sites have it all. Again, Betting.com
						strongly advises you to pick a sport and competition that you’re familiar with.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b className={styles.highlight}>Check to see what games are on.</b> The key to placing
						bets successfully lies in planning. Once you’ve decided to, let’s say, bet on the NBA,
						you can see the schedule for the next few days. Highlight a couple of interesting
						games.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b className={styles.highlight}>Enter the bet amount and submit the slip.</b> Before
						you do anything, double-check everything to make sure you haven’t made a mistake.
						Think of which amount you want to wager and click submit.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<span>
					See? It wasn’t that hard, was it? Let’s get a bit more detailed and see what sports can
					you bet on. The best online betting sites have variety down to a science, so there’s no
					telling what you might find at the end of the day.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div className={styles.block}>
				<h2>What Sports Can You Bet On?</h2>
				<span>
					The only legitimate answer to the question “what sports can you bet on?” would be –
					everything. From traditional sports to virtual games and even the weather – if it can be
					put into numbers, you can most definitely bet on it. But most websites give the following
					sports and leagues the most coverage:
